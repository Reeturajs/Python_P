Welcome to the Python and MySQL Projects repository! This repository hosts a collection of diverse projects developed using Python programming language and MySQL database management. Inside this repository, you will find a range of applications including a room booking system, a courier tracking system, and an alumni management system. These projects demonstrate the integration of Python's powerful capabilities with MySQL's efficient data handling to create practical and functional systems.
